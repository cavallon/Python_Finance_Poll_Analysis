# Python Financial & Voting Analysis Automation

# Summary:
The project aims to automate financial analysis and election vote counting processes using Python scripts. For the financial analysis (PyBank), the script calculates metrics such as total months, net profit/loss, average change, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits from a given dataset. For the election analysis (PyPoll), the script determines the total number of votes, each candidate's percentage of votes, and the election winner from another dataset. The results are printed to the terminal and exported to text files, streamlining the analysis tasks and showcasing the power of Python over traditional Excel-based approaches.

# FOR PYBANK (Financial Analysis):
1. This code file is labeled main.py and is found in the pybank main folder.

2. The resources file is located in Resources, and it is labeled budget_data.csv. 
    **if the relative path changes for this file, the code will not operate correctly. 
3. The solution file is a .txt file found in the analysis folder. It is labeled pybank_solution.txt.

# FOR PYPOL (Election Analysis)
1. The election analysis code file is labeled main.py and is found in the pypol main folder.

2. The resources file is located in Resources, and it is labeled election_data.csv. 
    **if the relative path changes for this file, the code will not operate correctly. 
3. The solution file is a .txt file found in the analysis folder. It is labeled pypol_results.txt
